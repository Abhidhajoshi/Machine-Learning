# Machine-Learning

<h2><i> Introduction </i></h2>

<p>
<h3>
Machine learning, a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. ML is the field of study which gives the computer the capability to learn without being explicity program. ML uses the past Output to genrate a program to generate futher prediction. This field is concern with Aritificial Intelligence ( to make machine to think like human ), to be able to perform an algorithm much better result with accurate prediction. Like, in youtube , youtube history is used to predict the watching content of the user and later suggesting recommended videos related respectively.

Machine Learning has many accurate models depended on different accuracy and data consistency. The accuracy is most important , which indicates the correctness of the model for the real life problems and to get more feedback to improve.

<h2>Types of Machine Learning:</h2>
<h3>1) Supervised Learning <br>
2) Unsupervised Learning<br>
3) Semi-Supervised Learning<br>
4) Reinforcement Learning <br></h3>

<h2>
1)  Supervised Machine Learning
</h2>
<h3>
-> Supervised Learning is the learning in which labelled or continuous data is use to predict by the help of the 
   historical data. This is use to predict the algorithm to interpret the result.

<h2>
2)  Unsupervised Machine Learning
</h2>
<h3>
-> Unsupervised Learning is the learning in which unlabelled or discrete data is given to machine for prediction.
   in this Machine itself analyze a pattern or symmetry in data and produce such model to predict the results.
