# Machine-Learning

<h2><i> Introduction </i></h2>
<p>
<h3>
Machine learning, a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. ML is the field of study which gives the computer the capability to learn without being explicity program. ML uses the past Output to genrate a program to generate futher prediction. This field is concern with Aritificial Intelligence ( to make machine to think like human ), to be able to perform an algorithm much better result with accurate prediction. Like, in youtube , youtube history is used to predict the watching content of the user and later suggesting recommended videos related respectively.
<br>
Machine Learning has many accurate models depended on different accuracy and data consistency. The accuracy is most important , which indicates the correctness of the model for the real life problems and to get more feedback to improve.
